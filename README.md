This project contains both a frontend and backend, both of which can be started with npm start. Instructions to utilize our Web App are below. The project aims to provide a simple yet intuitive solution for tutors and students to get connected. 

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
2. Install the necessary packages: npm install
3. Start the backend server: npm run start:server
4. In a new terminal, start the frontend development server: npm run start:client
5. The frontend should now be available at http://localhost:3000 and the backend at http://localhost:5000.


## Project Structure
The project is structured with the frontend in the client directory and the backend in the server directory. The root directory contains the common dependencies and scripts for starting the development servers. The sever side must exist before the client side is created.
